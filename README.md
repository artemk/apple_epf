# AppleEpf

## Installation
```ruby
  gem 'apple_epf'
```

## Setup

  Put this in your initializer.rb if you are using Rails.
```ruby
AppleEpf.configure do |config|
  config.apple_id = 'username'
  config.apple_password = 'password'
  config.download_retry_count = 3 #
  config.keep_tbz_after_extract = false
  config.extract_dir = '' # where to extract to
  config.files_matrix = {} # {popularity: ['application_popularity_per_genre']}
  #config.files_matrix = {itunes: [], pricing: [], popularity: []}
  config.download_processor = AppleEpf::AriaDownloadProcessor
  config.concurrent_downloads = 16
  config.log_file = "#{Rails.root}/log/apple_epf_#{Rails.env}.log"
  #config.archiver = :gnutar
  #config.archiver_path = "/usr/local/bin/tar"
end
```

  All of this can be redefined for every downloader.

## Manual manipulations

```ruby
  # Manually download one file
  downloader = AppleEpf::Downloader.new('incremental', 'popularity', Date.parse('17-01-2013'))
  downloader.download #=> will return local filepath to downloaded file or fire exception

  # Manually extract one archive
  extractor = AppleEpf::Extractor.new(filename, files_to_extract)
  # filename - full path to local file
  # files_to_extract - Files to be extracted from Archive (application, application_detail)
  file_entry = extractor.perform #=> will return instance of FileEntry
  file_entry.tbz_file #=> original file that was parsed. It is removed after untaring
  file_entry.extracted_files #=> newly created(unpacked) files

  #Manually parse file
  parser = AppleEpf::Parser.new(filename)
  # filename - full local path to file

  parser.process_rows do |r|
    puts "row is #{r}"
  end
```

## Download and Extract
  If you want to combine downloading and extracting your can use one of following
  methonds. My personal feeling is to parsing should we something live alone and should not be combined in one stack with download and extract. And of cource it is better to download and extract files one by one.

```ruby
  manager = AppleEpf::Incremental.new('10-10-2012', 
    { popularity: ['application_popularity_per_genre'] })


  manager = AppleEpf::Full.new('10-10-2012', 
    { popularity: ['application_popularity_per_genre'] })


  manager.download_all_files 
  # will download all files for this date 
  # for all keys "popularity", 'pricing', 'itunes' etc

  manager.download_and_extract_all_files 
  #will first download and than extract all files

  manager.download_and_extract('itunes', ['application', 'application_detail']) 
  # will download only 'itunes' and extract only ['application', 'application_detail']. 
  # This actually ignores matrix passed to initializer

  manager.download('itunes') #will only download file
```

  You can omit where to store files by setting it directly to downloader instance

```ruby
  manager.store_dir = '/whatever_dir_you_like'
  manager.download('itunes')
```

  OR

```ruby
  downloader = AppleEpf::Downloader.new('incremental', 'popularity', Date.parse('17-01-2013'))
  downloader.dirpath = '/whatever_dir_you_like'
  downloader.download
```

  You can also omit if you want to store initial tbz files after they will be unpacked

    extractor.keep_tbz_after_extract = true

  OR

    manager.keep_tbz_after_extract = true


## Get list of current files avaliable for download
```ruby
AppleEpf::Incremental.get_current_list #=> current incremental files
AppleEpf::Full.get_current_list #=> current full files
```

## Make sure to try AriaDownloadProcessor
  There are 2 downloaders avaliable for use:
  1. `CurbDownloadProcessor` - default one
  2. `AriaDownloadProcessor` - we use in production

  I suggest using last one, as in can do download in parallel. I sugest set 
  `config.concurrent_downloads = 16 or 8`. If you chose to use aria, make sure
  you have `aria2c` in your `PATH`.

  And of cource you write your own processor.

## Make sure to try lbzip2
  lbzip2 uncompress files in parallel. Thanks [@funkyboy](https://github.com/funkyboy) for his help.
  Just set `config.use_lbzip2 = true` and make sure you have it in `PATH`. On mac you can use `brew install lbzip2` for it.
